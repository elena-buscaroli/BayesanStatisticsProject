## Gene therapy (GT) {#gene-therapy-gt}

Gene therapy applications are employed to recover the functionality of a defective gene, causing a disease in the patient.

Specifically, a viral vector is used to insert in the patient cells genome, the correct sequence of the defective gene, to restore its functionality.

During cell replications, the cells with the "missing" gene will be replaced by the cells carrying the correct sequence. In particular, this is usually performed on Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), from which the different blood cell types originate.

## Possible problems in GT applications

The lentiviral insertion occurs at semi-random in the genome and this might:

-   cause gene deregulation,
-   give rise to mutations leading to cancerous cell populations.

Monitoring and studying such abnormalities over time in multiple lineages might help to improve the safety of GT applications.

**AIM:** reconstruct clones (cell populations) originated from the same HSC to monitor their evolution over time and across lineages.

# Data

## Experimental design

**Insertion Site (IS)**: defined as a sequence (i.e., the sequence carried by the vector) inserted in a specific genomic position. Since insertion is "random", each IS is unique and acts as a *barcode*.

**Locus coverage** (or *locus depth*): obtained from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), corresponds to the number of fragments mapping to the locus (i.e. genomic position).

a.  A set of HSCs is infected with lentiviral vectors carrying the same gene.

    Each HSC will have the sequence carried by the vector in a "random" position of the genome, a unique insertion site $\rightarrow$ each cell is *barcoded*.

    Each infected cell will carry more than one IS and each IS is unique.

b.  The barcoded HSCs replicates and each descendant will carry the parent's ISs.

    The HSCs will differentiate into three cell lineages.

    Mutations might arise in one branch of the differentiation tree.

c.  The genomic regions harbouring ISs are shredded into DNA fragments, which are sequenced to produce a set of sequencing reads.

    In this setting, the coverage of an IS is proportional to its abundance in the sample.

To sum up:

-   *clone:* set of cells originated from the same HSC and sharing the parent HSC's ISs;
-   *coverage* of an IS $\propto$ *abundance* of the clone carrying it in the sample;
-   ISs with similar coverage will likely belongs to the same clone;
-   multiple cell populations are present in heterogeneus proportions in the samples.

Therefore, to identify clones, we can cluster co-occurring ISs using their coverage over time and across lineages.

## Dataset

The dataset is a $N ✕ D$ matrix

-   $N$ rows $\rightarrow$ number of ISs,

-   $D$ columns $\rightarrow$ number of multi-lineages longitudinal observations.

Each entry $x_{n,d}$ of the matrix is the coverage of $n-$th IS in the $d-$th longitudinal sample.

```{r}
data = readRDS("data.Rds")
```

This dataset contains `570` ISs.

```{r}
data %>% lineaGT:::long_to_wide_cov() %>% nrow()
```

It contains samples from three lineages.

```{r}
data %>% dplyr::pull(lineage) %>% unique()
```

It contains observations over three timepoints.

```{r}
data %>% dplyr::pull(timepoints) %>% unique()
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  lineaGT:::long_to_wide_cov()
```

# Model description

This phenomenon can be modeled as a *mixture model*, where each mixture component corresponds to the multivariate distribution of coverage for a single clone.

A mixture model with $K$ components is defined as a superposition of $K$ densities:

$$
p(X) = \sum^K_{k=1} \pi_k p(X|\theta_k).
$$

Each density $p(X|\theta_k)$ is a component of the mixture, charachterized by parameter $\theta_k$.

The parameters $\pi_k$ are called *mixing coefficients* and are positive values such that $\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k = 1$.

In particular, the mixing proportions corresponds to the pior probability to pick a component, $p(k)=\pi_k$, and the densities $p(X|\theta_k)$ corresponds to the probability of $X$ conditioned on $k$.

We assign a data point to a specific component $k$ according to the posterior distribution

$$
p(k|X) = \frac{p(k)p(X|k)}{\sum_l p(l)p(X|l)} = \frac{\pi_kp(X|k)}{\sum_l \pi_lp(X|l)}.
$$

## Poisson mixture model

Since we are dealing with count-based data, the first developed model was a Poisson mixture model. However, since the Poisson rate corresponds also to distribution variance, it was not possible to identify clones with high mean (i.e., high coverage) and low variance.

## Multivariate Normal mixture model

We eventually developed and implemented a Multivariate Normal mixture model, in order to model the components variances and add model the correlation among dimensions.

<center>![](./images/pgm.png){width="588"}</center>

$Z$ is a $N-$dimensional vector of cluster assignments such that $z_n \in {1,…,K}$ and $p(z_n=k)=\pi_k$.

The model likelihood is

$$
p(X|Z,\pi,\mu,\Sigma) = \prod_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n|\mu_k,\Sigma_k).
$$

The model estimates the full covariance matrix, to infer also the correlation among dimensions, and it is decomposed as $\Sigma = SCS$:

-   $C$ is the correlation matrix, with unitary diagonal elements and off-diagonal correlation entries defined as $C_{d,l} = \frac{\sigma_{d,l}}{\sigma_d \sigma_l}$,
-   $S$ is a diagonal matrix $\sqrt{diag(\Sigma)}$, with dimensions' standard deviations $\sigma_d$ on the diagonal.

Therefore, the learned parameters are:

-   the $K ✕ D$ matrix of means $\mu$,
-   the $K ✕ D$ matrix or variances $\sigma$,
-   $K$ $D ✕ D$ correlation matrices $C$,
-   the $K-$dimensional vector of mixing proportions $\pi$,

and each observation is assigned to the cluster maximising the posterior $$
p(k|x_i) = \frac{\pi_k\mathcal{N}(x_i|k)}{\sum_{l=1}^K \pi_l \mathcal{N}(x_i|l)}.
$$

## Prior distributions

The latent variables and parameters of the model are $Z, \pi, \mu, \sigma$ and $C$:

-   $\pi \sim Dirichlet(\alpha) \rightarrow$ vector of latent mixing proportions $\pi$ is distributed as a Dirichlet (since it has to sum up to 1). All clusters are a priori assumed to have equal probability, hence $\alpha_k=1/K$.

-   $Z \sim Categorical(\pi) \rightarrow$ latent assignments vector $Z$ is distributed as a Categorical with concentration parameter $\pi$.

-   $p(\mu_{k,d}) \sim Normal(\mu^{mean}, \sigma^{mean}) \rightarrow$ the means prior is a Normal, with hyperparameters $\mu^{mean}, \sigma^{mean}$. By default, since we do no know a priori the range of coverage values, the hyperparameters values are set to the sample mean and standard deviations.

-   $p(\sigma_{k,d}) \sim Normal(\mu^{sigma}, \sigma^{sigma}) \rightarrow$ the variances prior are set as a Normal, constrained to assume only positive values, with hyperparameters $\mu^{sigma}, \sigma^{sigma}$. The values of the hyperparameters have been tuned using an experimental validation dataset to explore the true variability we are likely to observe in these experiments and are set to 120 and 130, respectively.

-   $p(C_{k}) \sim LKJ(\eta) \rightarrow$ the correlations prior is the Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe (LKJ) distribution, set with default hyperparameter $\eta=1$, assuming a uniform density over all correlation matrix, since we are not aware a priori of strong or weak correlations among dimensions.

## Model selection

In order to select for the optimal number of clusters $K$, we computed the BIC as $BIC = -2\text{log}(\mathcal{L}) + \text{log}(N)*n_{par}$ over a range of number of clusters and selected the input $K$ resulting in the lowest BIC.

# Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) {#stochastic-variational-inference-svi}

Given our models we want to learn values for the parameters $W = (Z,\mu,\sigma,C)$. The aim is to learn the posterior distribution of the latent parameters $$
p(W|X) = \frac{p(X|W)p(W)}{p(X)}.
$$ Ideally, we would like to find the set of parameters such as to maximise the log evidence, usually unfeasible to compute: $$
W^* = \text{argmax}_W \text{log}(p(X))
$$

The idea behind VI is to find a *variational distribution* $q(W)$ to approximate the true posterior $p(W|X)$. The task is an optimization problem, aiming at finding the distribution as to minimize the KL divergence between the variational and true posteriors: $$
q^*(W) = \text{argmin}_{q(W)\in\mathcal{Q}} KL[q(W)||p(W|X)].
$$

We can riformulate the KL as $$
KL[q(W)||p(W|X)] = \text{log}(p(X)) - \text{ELBO}
$$

$$
\text{ELBO} = \text{E}[\text{log}(p(X,W))] - \text{E}[\text{log}(q(W))]
$$ and $\text{ELBO} \leq \text{log}(p(X))$

The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a lower bound for the log evidence $p(X)$ and equals the log evidence when the variational distribution equals the true posterior (and $KL=0$).

Therefore, we can reformulate the problem of minimizing the KL divergence as to maximising the ELBO (or minising the negative ELBO).

This is done by taking gradient steps in both $p$ and $q$ parameter spaces simultaneously as to minimise the negative ELBO.

## Pyro implementation

In `Pyro` probabilistic programming language, this is carried out by defining two functions: a *model*, defining the generative model, and a *guide*, defining the variational distribution.
