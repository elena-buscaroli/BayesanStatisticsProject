The final project consists in the presentation of the model implemented in the [`pylineaGT`](https://github.com/caravagnalab/pylineaGT) Python package using Pyro.

An R interface for [`pylineaGT`](https://github.com/caravagnalab/pylineaGT) can be found in the [`lineaGT`](https://github.com/caravagnalab/lineaGT) package.

The repository contains the final report in `Rmarkdown` and `html` formats and sample dataset `data.Rds` and fitted object `x.Rds`.
